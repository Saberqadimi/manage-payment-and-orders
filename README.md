## Introduction

This package was developed in collaboration with a Sadratek team member and AdvanceLearn. This package aims to create
and manage various aspects related to user orders and payments. It includes tracking the number of products and tagging
all steps of the user's purchase order." This package is currently under active development and there are plans to add a
shopping voucher module in the future, pending support and feasibility.

##Create new Order By User Request
"In the initial step, it's important to note that we aim to store a user's order within the system. To achieve this, we need to send the required parameters to the 'store' method of the order service package. Upon successful validation of these parameters, we will receive a response containing the order details."
We receive and send the requested parameters from the user:
`$shippingId , $addressId , $description , $items`
**`__!!Pay attention to the type of parameters that they should be__`**
```php
app('orderFunction')->store(int $shippingId, int $addressId, string $description, array $items)
```
####example `$items` for passed to params:
For each model that is supposed to be able to be sold, a record must be created for it in the inventories table so that the warehouse quantity management of that model is also entered in that section, and after successful payment, a number is deducted from the number of models in that table. to be
```php
        $items = [
            0 => [
                "id" => 1,
                "price" => 145000,
                'quantity' => 2,
                "inventory_id" => 1
            ]
        ];
        $newOrder = app('orderFunction')->store(1, 1, "test from create new order",$items);
```

### add this method for Relationship in your model with Inventory

```php
    public function inventories()
    {
        return $this->morphMany(app('inventory'), 'adm_inventories');
    }

```

and add nameaspace this file in top youre model :

```php
use Advancelearn\ManagePaymentAndOrders\Models\Inventory;
```


"Now you have created a new order in the order creation phase, so to redirect the user to the payment gateway, you need to send this order id to this method, you can check whether the order amount has already been paid or not. In case of non-payment, you can redirect the user to the payment gateway."

```php
        $order = app('order')::findOrFail($orderId);

        if ($order->audits->where('id', app('auditTypes')::PAID)->count()) {
            return response()->json(['errors' => 'Already paid'], 422);
        }

```

And finally, send the final order amount to send to the portal:

```php
$invoice = new Invoice;

$invoice->amount($order->payment_price);
```

And in the same method that the user was sent to the payment portal, you can create a payment for the user with a
pending status:

```php
 app('payment')::create
 ([
    'order_id' => $order->id,
    'driver' => $request->input('driver'),
    'transaction_id' => //transactionId from your gateway sent request for pay,
    'amount' => $order->payment_price
]);
```

#### next step

And in the last step, you can receive the desired payment in the return method so that the payment is confirmed and
confirmed Update it to confirm. First, add the following relationship to the relevant model of the product example


```php
    public function paymentConfirmation($user_id, $inventory_id, $quantity)
    {
        $inventory = $this->inventories()->find($inventory_id);
        $inventory->count -= $quantity;
        $inventory->save();
    }
```

And for example, in your callback method that returns from the portal, let's assume that your callback method is called
paymentConfirmation.

```php
    public function paymentConfirmation(Request $request)
    {
        $payment = app('payment')::where('transaction_id', $transactionId)->first();
        $order = app('order')::find($payment->order_id);
         $receipt = //api call gateway for verifyPayment and get response add to this variable
        $this->verifyPayAndConfirm($payment, $order, $request);
//          return redirect('https://example.com?gatewayOrderID=' .
//           $paymentTransaction->OrderId ?? null . '&RRN=' .
//           $paymentTransaction->RRN ?? null);
    }
```

create call method verifyPayAndConfirm::

```php
    private function verifyPayAndConfirm($receipt, $payment, Request $request): void
    {
        $payment->reference_id = $receipt->getReferenceId();
        $payment->transaction = $request->all();
        $payment->driver = $receipt->getDriver();
        $payment->save();
        $order->audits()->attach([app('auditTypes')::PAID => ['description' => 'Payment was successful']]);
        foreach ($order->items as $item) {
            $item->PaymentConfirmation($order->address->user_id);
        }
        return $receipt;
    }
```
##Payment status

You can monitor the status of orders that have been prepared by checking each step where the new status should be documented. You can add a record related to the current stage of the order and you can reference the stage IDs from the adm_audits table.



**You can call this method to get all the information about your orders**
```php
app('orderFunction')->getOrders();
```
**Use this method to display individual information of an order**
```php
app('orderFunction')->show($order);
```
####Pay attention to the type of parameters
####You can use this method to update an order
You can create a new record in the adm_shippings table for the types of shipping steps and prices that must be calculated for shipping, and send its ID for calculation in the store or update method. Pay attention to this example.
```php
$shippingId = app('shipping')::find(1)->pluck('id')->first();
```
```php
 $auditId = app('audit')::find(2)->toArray();
 $items = [
    0 => [
        "id" => 1,
        "price" => 145000,
        'quantity' => 1,
        "inventory_id" => 1
    ]
];
app('orderFunction')->update(int $shippingId, int $addressId, string $description, string $shippingDate, array $items, int $audit, int $orderId);
```
####You can use this method to cancel the order By User
```php
 $delete =  app('orderFunction')->destroyByUser($orderId);
 return $delete;
```
####You can use this method to cancel the order By Admin
```php
  $delete =  app('orderFunction')->destroyByAdmin($orderId);
  return $delete;
```

## Conclusion
By utilizing this package, there is no need to create separate models for the order and payment processes. Moreover, it allows for the presentation of user information history and the management of these records. For instance, you can perform actions like updating the order status to various types and sections, organizing the order stages (e.g., sending the products, order cancellation, final registration, readiness for shipment), and moreâ€”all within a unified framework.
